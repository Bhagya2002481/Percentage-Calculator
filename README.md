# Percentage-Calculator
Develop a percentage calculator in Java with a simple graphical user interface (GUI). Implement functionalities to calculate percentages, percentage increases/decreases, and find the whole given a part and percentage.

**Description**

This is a simple Percentage Calculator application built using Java Swing. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing various percentage-related calculations, including:
----Calculating a percentage of a number.
----Determining percentage increase or decrease between two values.
----Finding the whole value given a part and percentage.
The application is designed to be user-friendly, with error handling for invalid inputs and clear instructions for use.

**Features**

----User-Friendly GUI: Simple and intuitive interface using Java Swing.
----Multiple Calculation Modes:
      Calculate percentage (e.g., X% of Y).
      Find percentage increase or decrease.
      Determine the whole when given a part and percentage.
----Error Handling: Prevents incorrect input and handles division by zero.
----Well-Documented Code: Modular, maintainable, and optimized for accuracy.

**Note:-Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or later).**

**Usage**

---Open the application.
---Select the desired calculation type from the dropdown menu.
---Enter the required input values.
---Click the Calculate button.
---View the result displayed below the button.

**Example Calculations**

1)Calculate Percentage
    Enter 50 in "Input 1" (part) and 80 in "Input 2" (whole value).
    Click Calculate → Result should be 62.50%.
2)Percentage Increase/Decrease
    Enter 100 in "Input 1" and 150 in "Input 2".
    Click Calculate → Result should be 50.00% (increase from 100 to 150).
3)Find Whole from Part and Percentage
    Enter 50 in "Input 1" and 25 in "Input 2".
    Click Calculate → Result should be 200.00.

**Error Handling**

---Displays an error message if non-numeric values are entered.
---Prevents division by zero in calculations.

**Future Improvements**

---Add keyboard shortcuts for better accessibility.
---Implement a history feature to track previous calculations.
---Enhance UI with a more modern look.
